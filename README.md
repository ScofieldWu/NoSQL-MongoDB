# NoSQL-MongoDB

The goal of this assignment is to gain familiarity with MongoDB, one of the most widely-used tools for the management and querying of big, unstructured data.

MongoDB uses the JSON (and related BSON) format for data, as we saw in class.
The MongoDB shell provides an interactive JavaScript interface to MongoDB.
We will provide JavaScript templates for each question so that you can see how the syntax works.

The mongodb manual is here: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/mongo/
